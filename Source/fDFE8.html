	<h2>The Gaá¹acakra Ritual</h2>
<p><em>by Sakya Paá¹á¸ita</em></p>
<p><em>With devotion I prostrate to my noble teacher!</em> </p>
<p><em>Bowing to my teacher,<br/>
The single embodiment of all the buddhas,<br/>
To bring accomplishment of the accumulations of merit and wisdom,<br/>
I shall explain the ritual which does so.</em> </p>
<p>If you wish to perform the gaá¹acakra taught in the niruttarayoga tantrasâthe highest yoga tantrasâsuch as those of the tathÄgatas ÅrÄ« Hevajra or ÅrÄ« Cakrasaá¹vara, there are three points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I. How to perform the ritual<br/>
II. The refutation of objections<br/>
III. The divisions of the ritual </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>I. How to Perform the Ritual</h2>
<p>First, the manner in which the ritual is performed consists of six points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Place</li>
<li>Fellow practitioners</li>
<li>Substances</li>
<li>The ritual itself</li>
<li>Necessity</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>1. Time</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>a) Periodic occasions<br/>
b) Special occasions </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>a) Periodic Occasions</h4>
<p>These fall on the eighth, tenth, fourteenth and fifteenth days of the waxing and waning moon.</p>
<h4>b) Special Occasions</h4>
<p>These occur when empowerments are given, during a consecration, when a fire offering is performed or when the tantras are taught.</p>
<h3>2. Place</h3>
<p>A beginner performs the ritual in places hidden from those who have not received the empowerment, such as in one's own home or a shrine room. Those who have stabilized their minds perform the ritual in such places as charnel grounds or sacred mountain caves. Those who have reached accomplishment perform the ritual in locations such as the twenty-four sacred places.</p>
<h3>3. Fellow Practitioners</h3>
<p>Oneâs fellow practitioners should be vÄ«ras and yoginÄ«s<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> who have received the empowerment and have not broken their samayas.</p>
<h3>4. Substances</h3>
<p>Although the substances consist of whatever articles you are able to acquire, the indispensable substances for the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s are <em>madana</em> and <em>bala</em>.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
<h3>5. The Ritual</h3>
<p>The ritual is divided into three parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) The preparation<br/>
b) The main part<br/>
c) The conclusion </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>a) The Preparation</h4>
<p>The preparation consists of six points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i. Decoration of the practice place<br/>
ii. Arrangement of the outer and inner offering articles<br/>
iii. Invitation of the vajra master to come and preside over the ceremony<br/>
iv. Communication through secret hand-gestures for entering the place<br/>
v. Performance of the deity yoga and requesting the deities to take their seats<br/>
vi. Recitation of the hundred-syllable mantra for purifying the mind </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>i. Decoration of the Practice Place</h5>
<p>First, clean the practice place. Then anoint it with the five substances of a cow, sprinkle scented water, hang canopies and flower garlands, and set up a painting of the deities. If the focus of the practice lies mainly on the self-visualization, in accordance with the number of deities of the self-visualization, such as of Hevajra or Cakrasaá¹vara, arrange seats covered with tiger-skins or charnel ground shrouds. If you do not have these it is fine to arrange other appropriate seats. Arrange the seats in a circle according to how the deities are seated within the maá¹á¸ala.</p>
<p>If the focus lies mainly on the front-visualization, arrange an accomplishment maá¹á¸ala, as taught in the traditional scriptures such as the <em>Hevajra</em> or <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>. With the vajra master taking the principal seat of the assembly, the other practitioners sit according to seniority. The practice focusing mainly on the self-visualization is taught in <em>The Two Segments</em>.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> The practice focusing on mainly the front-visualization is taught in such scriptures as the <em>Sampuá¹­a-tantra</em><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> and elsewhere. It is said that it is easier for beginners to offer the feast mainly to the front-visualization.</p>
<h5>ii. Arrangement of the Outer and Inner Offering Articles</h5>
<p>According to <em>Hevajra</em> three or four water offerings should be arranged. According to the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>, the water offerings can be confined to the two for drinking and washing the hands and feet. Here, the additional water offerings are part of the arranged offerings.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> Thus when you recite &quot;we present the offerings (... <em>chÃ¶par bul</em>),&quot; all the water offerings are included within the arranged offerings.</p>
<p>When you offer the four waters: first, mix the water for washing the hands and feet with pleasant smelling substances such as camphor and saffron; second, mix the water for washing the face with the three sweets; third, prepare clean water for drinking; and, fourth, decorate the offering water with white flowers. Then prepare whatever you can afford for the remaining five offerings of the flowers and so forth. Arrange the shrine as elaborately as possible.</p>
<p>According to the traditional scriptures of <em>Hevajra</em> and <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>, you should place one torma for the supermundane deities, one torma for the primary mundane dharmapÄlas, and one torma for the local deities. If required you can also arrange further tormas. If you can afford the expense, the more abundantly you can arrange the shrine, the better.</p>
<p>Next, fill the <em>padma-bhÄjana</em><a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> with <em>madana</em> and place it in front of you with the skull's forehead facing you. Place the samaya implements of vajra and bell in order, to the right and left before you. Arrange, too, whatever delightful articles you are able to acquire. Take care of all these necessities as the preliminary to the following steps.</p>
<h5>iii. Invitation of the Vajra Master</h5>
<p>Offer as many maá¹á¸alas and flowers to the vajra master as you can and request the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please preside as the vajra master over this assembly to perform this offering of all the mundane and supermundane for the benefit of all sentient beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you make offerings primarily to the self-visualization, the vajra master sits upon a specially prepared seat in the centre of the assembly. When emphasizing the front-visualization, the vajra master sits upon a specially prepared seat at the head of the assembly.</p>
<h5>iv. Communication through Secret Hand Gestures for Entering the Place</h5>
<p>With the vajra pride of being NÄ«ladaá¹á¸a,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> the ritual assistant holds the activity vase and remains at the entrance to the practice place. By communicating through secret signs with the initiated, he is able to identify those who are unqualified to enter and send them away.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> In order to gain entrance the initiated then recite the following verse together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark blue ferocious one, your conduct according to the samayas is splendid! Holder of the bejewelled staff of accomplishment, let us heroes and heroines gather! Let us enter the circle of celestial yoginÄ«s!<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, the guard, NÄ«ladaá¹á¸a, cleanses them with the water from the activity vase and replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold all phenomena as excellent!<br/>
Have no doubts regarding all that is gathered.<br/>
Eat and regard brahmins, dogs, and untouchables<br/>
As equal in nature!<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having recited the verse, the guard then grants access. Since it is difficult to perform this entrance ritual correctly and it can reduce the power of the main ritual if done incorrectly, should the participants lack sufficient knowledge, they can simply arouse the pride of being the deity and mindfully enter the practice place. Then once the vajra master has taken his seat first, the other practitioners follow according to seniority.</p>
<h5>v. Invocation</h5>
<p>The ritual assistant offers the general maá¹á¸ala and places flowers in the hands of those assembled. Prostrating with joined hands, he recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With great cloud-like offerings of Samantabhadra's magical display, we vÄ«ras and yoginÄ«s make offerings in order to pacify obstacles for the benefactors and gather the two accumulations. Please preside over us, therefore, in non-dual samÄdhi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also possible to recite the abbreviated request: &quot;Please preside over us within the yoga of your main deity.&quot; Following this, the ritual assistant collects the flowers again and offers them to the teacher. The teacher in turn offers them to the lineage masters and yidam deities, then places the flowers in the centre of the maá¹á¸ala.</p>
<h5>vi. Purifying the Mind</h5>
<p>In order for the assembly to confess breakages of samaya, meditate on Vajrasattva on the crown of your head and recite an appropriate number of hundred-syllable mantras, according to the pith instructions. Then recite the following words from the <em>AbhidhÄna</em>:<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my ignorance and delusion<br/>
I have gone against and corrupted my samaya.<br/>
Guru, protector, be my refuge!<br/>
Chief of all the maá¹á¸alas, vajra holder,<br/>
Embodiment of great compassion,<br/>
Chief of all living beings, in you I take refuge! </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>b) Main Part</h4>
<p>The main part consists of the sixfold satisfaction. According to the explanatory tradition of the embodiment of all the mahÄyoga tantras, the <em>Sampuá¹­a-tantra</em>, these are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i. To satisfy the samÄdhi-maá¹á¸ala with vast offerings<br/>
ii. To satisfy the wisdom deity in the heart with the taste of amá¹ta<br/>
iii. To satisfy the outer hordes of spirits with the torma<br/>
iv. To satisfy the samaya-holders, the vÄ«ras and yoginÄ«s, with the inner fire offering<br/>
v. To satisfy the outer and inner á¸ÄkinÄ«s with offerings of songs and dance<br/>
vi. To satisfy the body maá¹á¸ala with co-emergent wisdom</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>i. Satisfying the SamÄdhi-Maá¹á¸ala with Vast Offerings</h5>
<p>According to the <em>Hevajra</em>, you should begin the practice by following the extensive or condensed visualization for the invitation of the field of merit until the protection circle. Among the ten topics,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> in order to carry out the branches of protection and averting, recite the <em>uá¹£nÄ«á¹£Ä</em>-mantra<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> as many times as possible. The mantra will grant protection from obstacles now and create the auspicious conditions for overpowering the mÄras on the eve of your awakening. According to the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>, we simply meditate on the protection circle, and it is not necessary to recite the mantra at this point. Next, meditate gradually on the development and completion phases according to whichever ritual text you follow, such as the <em>Hevajra</em> or the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>.</p>
<p>Then, focus on reciting the respective root, heart, and quintessence mantras of the main deity, and recite the mantras of their retinue as many times as you can. Through practicing the development and completion stages together with the mantra recitation you will accomplish the accumulation of merit and wisdom at the time of the cause, purify buddha-fields, ripen sentient beings, and purify the negative tendencies of body, speech and mind which cause rebirth in the lower realms. You will thus set the auspicious conditions for attaining the three or four kÄyas and create the auspicious conditions for attaining awakening in Akaniá¹£á¹­ha, and for accomplishing the benefit of sentient beings with immeasurable emanations in countless realms at the time of the fruition. This is how to cultivate the samÄdhi-maá¹á¸ala.</p>
<p>Regarding the satisfaction of the samÄdhi-maá¹á¸ala with vast offerings: according to the <em>Hevajra</em>, first, recite &quot;<em>oá¹ vajrÄmá¹ta-kuá¹á¸ali hana hana hÅ«á¹ hÅ«á¹ phaá¹­</em>,&quot; and sprinkle the <em>madana</em> with the tip of the vajra in order to purify the physically arranged outer offerings. According to the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>, imagine purifying the offerings with the '<em>Åumbha-ni</em> mantra'<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> and dissolving all objectsâthe offerings, the practitioner(s) who offer(s) them and the act of offeringâinto emptiness with the '<em>svabhÄva</em> mantra'.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> Then, imagine that out of emptiness the previous concepts of the offerings, the practitioner(s) who offer(s) them and the act of offering, now arise in the form of the deity like a dream-like, magical display. Imagine all these offerings as arisen from the virtue of both the mundane and supermundane, excellent, clean, pure, unobstructed, filling the sky entirely, and continuously appearing for as long as saá¹sÄra remains.</p>
<p>Now offer them with mantra, samÄdhi and mudrÄ as taught in the tantras. Using mantras and mudrÄs that are not taught in the tantras would render the ritual impure, with the result that the buddhas would not delight in your offerings. If you wish to delight the buddhas, you must use the actual words spoken by the buddhas. Then consecrate the inner offerings of amá¹ta just as you did with the torma. Sprinkle the inner offerings with the left thumb and ring-finger and offer them first to your root teacher, then to the lineage master and the yidam deities. Next, offer them to the dharmapÄlas, spirits and so forth while reciting the individual mantras of the respective deities.</p>
<h5>ii. Satisfying the Wisdom Deity in the Heart with the Taste of Amá¹ta</h5>
<p>With your ring finger put a drop of amá¹ta on the tip of your tongue, between your eyebrows and on the crown of your head while reciting:<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To each yoginiÌ in turn,<br/>
The yogin makes offerings<br/>
With a sprinkle of the thumb.<br/>
Visualizing the yoginÄ«s in the three places of his body<br/>
The clever yogin makes offerings<br/>
To the tip of the tongue, the bindu, and above. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the <em>Hevajra</em>, you then ring the bell and recite offerings and praises, such as, &quot;Picturing him, the venerable one, in the sky above...,&quot;<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> the offering of the eight goddesses, the praise beginning with &quot;All you yoginÄ«s who have gathered in this gaá¹acakra...,&quot;<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> and <em>The Praise in Twenty Verses</em>.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> According to the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>, you recite offerings and praises, such as <em>The Praise to the Buddhas in the Ten Directions</em>,<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> the praise by master BhÅ«ri,<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> and <em>The Eight-Part Root Mantra of the TathÄgata</em>.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> To avoid confusion, I shall not go into more detail here. Should you require further explanations, consult such texts as <em>The Offering Garland</em> by our precious teacher.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a></p>
<h5>iii. Satisfying the Hordes of Spirits with the Torma</h5>
<p>When giving the torma to spirits that have not received the empowerment, the torma must be covered with a cloth as it is carried outside. The torma offered to those spirits who <em>have</em> received the empowerment does not need to be covered by such a cloth. Perform the torma offering ritual for the supermundane deities according to the respective tantra of your practice, such as the <em>Hevajra</em> or <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>. To offer the torma for the mundane deities to the dharmapÄlas, follow the ritual as given in the respective practice text. Next, give the general torma of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s to all the spirits. Then, when giving the torma of the local deities and the other tormas, focus on the recipients of the tormas and recite the mantra for giving the torma that begins, &quot;<em>oá¹ akÄro</em>...&quot;.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a> All the spirits will thereby become delighted and satisfied. The torma ritual itself is explained in detail in other texts.</p>
<h5>iv. Satisfying the Samaya-Holders, the VÄ«ras and YoginÄ«s</h5>
<p>To satisfy the samaya-holders, the vÄ«ras and yoginÄ«s, present them with offerings of the five sensory pleasures, such as flowers and so forth. As regards the feast articles, there are two traditions: one for those who have taken ordination and observe the precepts, and one for yogins. According to the first, the ordained should merely taste<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a> the offerings and tormas that contain substances such as meat and alcohol. Furthermore, they bless the tormas containing sugar, fruits and other clean substances, and consume them while imagining that they contain the five meats and five amá¹tas. This way none of the thirteen root downfalls can occur and the buddhas, bodhisattvas and wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s will bestow their blessings. The <em>GuhyasamÄja</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the substances do not even contain meat<br/>
Create all the substances through your imagination.<br/>
When these are consumed joined with the vajra,<br/>
All the buddhas will grant their blessings. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Sampuá¹­a</em> also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it is not meat, imagine it to be meat.<br/>
Whatever worldly people eat is consumed.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the tradition of practicing the gaá¹acakra according to the master Äryadeva, who was the spiritual heir of the Indian master NÄgÄrjuna, and according to Asaá¹ga and Vasubandhu, the great lord AtiÅa, my learned teacher ÅÄkyaÅrÄ«bhadra, and others. It is excellent, therefore, for the ordained to perform the gaá¹acakra in this way on such occasions as empowerments.</p>
<p>For the yoginsâ tradition of practicing gaá¹acakra, cleanse as before whatever samaya substances you can acquire, such as <em>madana,</em> <em>bala</em>, and so forth. Sprinkle the substances with cleansing water while reciting &quot;<em>oá¹ Äá¸¥ hÅ«á¹ ha ho hrÄ«á¸¥</em>.&quot; Imagine that with <em>ha</em> their appearance becomes irresistible, with <em>ho</em> their aroma becomes irresistible, and with <em>hrÄ«á¸¥</em> their potency becomes irrepressible. With <em>oá¹, Äá¸¥,</em> and <em>hÅ«á¹</em>, they transform into wisdom nectar. Pour a little bit of <em>madana</em> for each participant, but imagine that everyone drinks it from the same bowl.</p>
<p>Then, present the main offerings to the master and the maá¹á¸ala. Next, offer whatever tormas you have prepared. If an empowerment is to be given, the master will now practice the maá¹á¸ala of the tathÄgatas.<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a> During meditative equipoise, he will maintain the generation and completion phases of the maá¹á¸ala of the tathÄgatas and make offerings to the deities of consecration. All recipients of the torma, including any spirits, should be seen as buddhas when given the offerings. If not, it is said that the fault of 'a king worshipping his servants' or 'a monk worshipping the householders' will occur.</p>
<p>Doing this correctly will create the auspicious circumstances for the buddhas to be delighted and the spirits to be satisfied. Next, pour <em>madana</em> into the <em>padma-bhÄjana</em> and with your left ring finger take some <em>bala</em> and perform the lotus mudrÄ. Hold the <em>padma-bhÄjana</em> in your right hand while partially covering it with your left hand and offer it. The recipients likewise perform the lotus mudrÄ and then receive it. As the <em>Two Segments</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Offered with lotus hands,<br/>
It is received with lotus hands. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leader then recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold all phenomena as excellent!<br/>
Have no doubts regarding all that is gathered.<br/>
Eat and regard brahmins, dogs, and untouchables<br/>
As equal in nature! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recipients reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The teaching of the Sugata is priceless!<br/>
With devotion I pay homage to suchness,<br/>
Which is free from stains such as passion,<br/>
And devoid of grasper and grasped. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should know the meaning of these verses. While the leader and the recipients then both say &quot;<em>aho sukha</em>&quot; the offerings are distributed. These verses, which derive from the <em>Sampuá¹­a-tantra</em>, were originally composed in Prakrit not Sanskrit.<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a> Since they were difficult for the lotsÄwas to comprehend, a few translation errors occurred. The translation above, however, is flawless.</p>
<p>Next imagine that you bless the offerings as before and enjoy them as an offering to the maá¹á¸ala. Practitioners of <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em> should now perform the 'hand worship.'<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> The significance of receiving from the same bowl is explained in the <em>Two Segments,</em> while different bowls are used according to the <em>Sampuá¹­a</em>.</p>
<p>The ritual assistant should not put the primary bowl directly on the ground without a support until all the students have received the offerings. There is however no fault in putting the bowl on the floor after the vajra students have received the offerings. Once you have distributed the offerings, do not turn the bowl upside down until you leave. Do not leave the bowl empty either. It is auspicious to leave just a little food and drink in the bowl.</p>
<p>Do not argue or joke about during the gaá¹acakra. Discuss only what delights the mind or is on the subject of Dharma. Do not leave the assembly without permission from the guru or the assembly. Do not become intoxicated. Do not allow ordinary perception to take over. Do not forget to maintain the perception of the yidam deity. Do not entertain thoughts about samaya-holders being good or bad, or harbour concepts regarding the purity or impurity of the blessed substances. Instructions such as these on proper and improper behaviour may be found in the gaá¹acakra commentaries called the <em>Five Samayas</em> and <em>Advice on the Uncommon Meaning</em> and elsewhere.<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a></p>
<p>When a beginner or someone with a steady mind practices the gaá¹acakra conduct in one of the twenty-four sacred places but fails to communicate with secret signs, the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s will not confer blessings and the activity á¸ÄkinÄ«s will create obstacles. The <em>Two Segments</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O mahÄsattva Vajragarbha,<br/>
The secret language is wondrous.<br/>
Whatever I teach you,<br/>
You must retain with devotion.<br/>
Once you have received the Hevajra empowerment,<br/>
If you do not use the secret language,<br/>
Your samayas will decline.<br/>
There is no doubt about this. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After you have received the specific samayas,<br/>
If you do not employ the language,<br/>
The á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the four sacred places<br/>
Will show you their wrath within this lifetime. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar statements are to be found in all the tantras, including the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em> and others. Gain expertise, therefore, in the secret language: <em>madana</em> means alcohol; <em>bala</em> means meat; <em>tá¹ptikara</em> are foods such as grains; <em>tÄ«ndhana</em> are vegetables and herbs; <em>padma-bhÄjana</em> is a skull, and even if the vessel is not a skull, you should visualize it as a skull and call it <em>padma-bhÄjana;</em> <em>ká¹pÄ«ta</em> is a hand-drum; <em>kÄliÃ±jara</em> are those who have received the empowerment and uphold the samayas; <em>dundura</em> are those who have not received the empowerment and do not uphold the samayas; <em>preá¹khaá¹a</em> means arriving; <em>kheá¹­a</em> means going; and, <em>niraá¹Åuka</em> refers to bone ornaments. These are some of the secret words to be used.<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a></p>
<p>Men are referred to with the syllable <em>á¸a</em>, and women with the syllable <em>á¸Ä«</em>. These are two samples of the secret signs that are to be used.<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a> The practitioner should gain expertise in the secret language taught in the <em>Hevajra</em> and <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>. The tantras teach that if you do not know the secret language obstacles will arise when practicing the gaá¹acakra and when traveling to the twenty-four sacred sites. But those who do know the secret language will swiftly reap the siddhis.</p>
<h5>v. Satisfying with the Offering of Song and Dance</h5>
<p>Offering a song or dance will attract the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s, stabilize the visualization of the maá¹á¸ala of the tathÄgatas and provide protection for oneself and those assembled. If a man offers a song, he should generate the vajra pride of being AmitÄyus, and if he offers a dance, he should generate the vajra pride of being Vairocana. If a woman offers a song, she should generate the vajra pride of being PÄá¹á¸aravÄsinÄ«, and if she offers a dance, she should generate the vajra pride of being BuddhalocanÄ. The <em>Two Segments</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One should perform song and dance
By singing and dancing as
Vajradharma, BuddhalocanÄ,
The yoginÄ«s, and the mÄtá¹s.
Just this protects the assembly
And oneself as well.
Just this magnetizes the world,
And this performs mantra recitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the vÄ«ras and yoginÄ«s who hold the samaya perform song and dance, there will be the scent of garlic, vultures, camphor, or sandalwood, and the sounds of swans, bees, and wolves. These signs indicate that the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s have gathered, according to <em>Hevajra</em>.</p>
<h5>vi. Satisfying with Co-Emergent Wisdom</h5>
<p>If the vÄ«ras are practitioners of the Path of the Messenger<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a> and are able to retain the winds, they can perform the actual practice of the Path of the Messenger at this point. However, if they do not practice the Path of the Messenger and are unable to retain the winds, they can sprinkle a little bit of butter, ghee, or <em>madana</em> on their heart centre and simply rest in meditative equipoise while visualizing themselves as the heruka in union, with their guru resting on their crowns, and while recollecting that all appearances are the maá¹á¸ala of the tathÄgatas. Thus, rest in the samÄdhi of bliss and emptiness. The master á¸ombi Heruka said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus apply butter and ghee<br/>
To your heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This concludes the explanation of the main part, the six satisfactions.</p>
<h4>c) Conclusion of the Ritual</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>i. The remainder is offered to entrust the outer spirits with activities;<br/>
ii. Prayers of dedication and auspiciousness are recited for the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s to remain present;<br/>
iii. The hundred-syllable mantra is recited to make up for additions or omissions to the ritual;<br/>
iv. Aspiration prayers are recited so that accumulated merit bears the right fruition;<br/>
v. The guests of the front visualization are requested to depart and the torma is dispatched;<br/>
vi. Protection is established and after the ritual, the visualiztion is disolved. </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>i. Offering the Remainder</h5>
<p>Place the remainder torma in the front and put a little <em>madana</em> in your mouth. Pick up the remainder with the 'blazing hand mudrÄ' while saying <em>bhrÅ«á¹</em> or <em>pheá¹</em> and spit on it.<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a> Bless it with the three syllablesâ<em>oá¹, aá¸¥</em> and <em>hÅ«á¹</em>âand recite the mantra &quot;<em>oá¹ akÄro mukhaá¹ sarvadharmÄnÄm ÄdyanutpannatvÄt oá¹ Äá¸¥ hÅ«á¹ phaá¹­ svÄhÄ.</em>&quot; Alternatively, recite &quot;<em>oá¹ ucchiá¹£á¹­a-baliá¹gte bhaká¹£asi svÄhÄ.</em>&quot; Repeat these mantras three or seven times. Imagine that all the spirits who receive the remainder are thereby satisfied.</p>
<h5>ii. Prayers of Dedication and Auspiciousness</h5>
<p>In order for the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s to remain present and grant their blessings and auspiciousness, hold the vajra and bell and recite the vajra song that begins &quot;<em>kollaire á¹­á¹­ia</em>...&quot;<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a> as well as such prayers of auspiciousness as &quot;Apparent magnificence, like a mountain of goldâ¦â etc.<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a> At this point it is not permissible to chant songs and verses of auspiciousness that were composed by ordinary people, only songs and verses of auspiciousness spoken by the buddhas. Still, there is no fault in chanting such songs and verses of auspiciousness before gathering the remainder inside and offering the torma.</p>
<p>Mix the select portion with the remainder<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a> and dispose of them somewhere outside, such as at a crossroad. According to the <em>Sampuá¹­a</em>, you should draw a maá¹á¸ala with the toe of your right foot, play the á¸amaru made of two skulls, and say the name of the á¸ÄkinÄ« whom you entrust with activities together with &quot;<em>phreá¹ hÅ«á¹</em>.&quot; For example, if you entrust Taraá¹giá¹Ä« with activities, say &quot;Taraá¹giá¹Ä«! <em>Phreá¹ hÅ«á¹</em>!&quot; Then dispose of the torma outside, and chant vajra songs and verses of auspiciousness inside, so that the wisdom á¸Äkiá¹Ä«s gather.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to guard against the evil influences of shadow spirits,<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a> place a candle next to the torma and only then dispose of it. Praises to the dharmapÄlas, entrustment with activities, offerings made by the sponsors, and prayers for auspiciousness should be recited before offering the remainder torma. Rituals for restoring the samayas can be done at this point or together with offering the torma to the supermundane guests. The remaining activities are to be performed afterwards.</p>
<h5>iii. Recitation of the Hundred-Syllable Mantra</h5>
<p>To make up for additions or omissions to the ritual, physically join your vajra palms at your heart and mentally confess all wrongdoing. Imagine that all additions or omissions to the ritual are remedied thereby while reciting the hundred-syllable mantra. Then recite aloud the verses that begin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my ignorance and delusion<br/>
I have gone against and corrupted my samaya.<br/>
Lama protector, be my refuge!<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a><br/>
... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For anything lacking or incomplete,<br/>
For any mistakes I made or had others make,<br/>
Due to my ignorance and confusion,<br/>
Protectors, please forgive them all! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever mistakes I, a mere beginner, may have committedâsuch as unclear samÄdhi, a dull or agitated mind, improper performance of the ritual, impure substances, excess or declineâplease forgive them all, I pray! </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>iv. Recitation of Aspiration Prayers for the Accumulated Merit to Bear the Right Fruition</h5>
<p>Join your vajra palms at your heart, and recite the following verses from the <em>Hevajra</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this life and all my lives to come,<br/>
May I always be born into a noble family and uphold the samayas.<br/>
With my senses intact, may I receive and teach the Hevajra,<br/>
And be kind-hearted and devoted to my teacher!<br/>
In this life and all my lives to come,<br/>
May I always bear the vajra and bell,<br/>
Understand the profound Dharma,<br/>
And enjoy with equality the essence of women. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also recite the following verse from the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goddesses are the truth as samayas are the truth.<br/>
Thus their speech is likewise the highest truth.<br/>
By the power of the truth of this practice,<br/>
May the goddesses always care for me! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recite this verse from the <em>Sampuá¹­a</em> as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May all beings be happy!<br/>
May all beings be well!<br/>
May they traverse the path<br/>
By which they will attain awakening!<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recite these and other aspiration prayers found in the tantras. Then recite whatever dedication prayers you know from the sÅ«tras, such as &quot;Just as the bodhisattva MaÃ±juÅrÄ« attained omniscience...&quot;<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a> Thus dedicate the merit extensively with a mind free from the three spheres and mental poisons. Depending upon the occasion, you could also add prayers aspiring to a long life, good health, prosperity and good fortune, or whatever you desire.</p>
<h5>v. Requesting the Guests of the Front Visualization to Depart</h5>
<p>Recite the hundred-syllable mantra followed by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oá¹! You who've served all beings:<br/>
Grant us the respective siddhis!<br/>
Even though you now depart for your buddha realm,<br/>
I pray that you may return. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this verse the jÃ±Änasattvas of the front visualization are requested to depart and the visualization dissolves into you. You do not need to request the jÃ±Änasattvas of the self-visualization to depart according to the MahÄyoga tradition.</p>
<h5>vi. The Protection and the Dissolution after the Ritual</h5>
<p>According to the <em>Hevajra</em>, bringing to mind the Heruka of the session breaks will bless your sense faculties and their objects as well as your body, speech and mind. According to the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em>, reciting the <em>sumbhani</em>-mantra<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a> and snapping your fingers ensure that you are guarded everywhere and protected by the armour of the male and female vÄ«ras, and by the great armour. Seal the practice with the eight-part mantra<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a> and dissolve the main visualization after the ritual.<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a> Then rest as you like. This concludes the explanation of the conclusion of the ritual.</p>
<h3>6. Necessity</h3>
<p>All the accumulations of merit and wisdom are included within this ritual. <em>The Vajra Tent</em> states:<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[45]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the vajra-like samÄdhi of the oceanic accumulation of merit and wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is called &quot;the vajra delight&quot;<a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a> and so forth, since it pleases the buddhas, the bodhisattvas abiding on the ten <em>bhÅ«mis</em>, the eight types of ÅrÄvakas, the dull and sharp pratekyabuddhas, the worldly gods of the desire, form and formless realms, the protectors and guardians of the Dharma, the worldly guests such as hell-beings and pretas, and all the supermundane guests. They are all pleased and fully satisfied. The <em>Vajra Tent</em> elaborates upon this further. However, this will not be shared here and those who are interested can read the tantra itself. The ritual will likewise bring about all the worldly and transcendent siddhis. The <em>Two Segments</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever one eats, all the sensual delights<br/>
Will transform into siddhis for practitioners. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tantras also speak of the ritual's countless further benefits, so you can consult these scriptural sources directly.</p>
<h2>II. Refutation of Objections</h2>
<p>This consists of three points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>View</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Conduct</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Some noble ÅrÄvakas believe that first, the <strong>view</strong> of the MahÄyÄna is at fault. They argue that while the MahÄyÄna establishes form and the rest as valid cognitions, the <em>PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</em> states that &quot;there is no form, no sensationâ¦etc., up to and including &quot;no omniscient Buddha.&quot;<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a> Therefore, our scriptures and reasoning contradict one another.</p>
<p>Second, they claim that <strong>meditation</strong> is at fault, since an ordinary person's body, speech, and mind will not become those of a buddha simply by meditating upon them as being the buddha.</p>
<p>Third, they believe <strong>conduct</strong> to be at fault, since the MahÄyÄna states that the conduct of an ordained person's body and speech must be pure, but also states that pure and impure are equal.</p>
<p>Let us respond to these objections. </p>
<h3>1. View</h3>
<p>Regarding the <strong>view</strong> of emptiness, there is no fault. While you would be correct if we negated appearances, such as form, there is no fault in the MahÄyÄna, since we negate their true existence. The elaborate answer to this is provided in MahÄyÄna scriptures such as <em>The Ornament of SÅ«tras</em> in its chapter on &quot;Establishing the Buddha's Words&quot;.<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a></p>
<h3>2. Meditation</h3>
<p>Second, the <strong>meditation</strong> is not at fault. Meditating on the pervasiveness of earth, for example, will give rise to the corresponding samÄdhi of the earth and so forth.<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[49]</a> Likewise, meditating on your yidam deity will bring about the samÄdhi of the yidam deity. Similarly, when the ÅrÄvakas imagine skeletons, for example, in their meditation their perception changes accordingly.</p>
<h3>3. Conduct</h3>
<p>Third, regarding MahÄyÄna <strong>conduct</strong>, there are three objections to be refuted with regard to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) The object of veneration<br/>
b) Time<br/>
c) Substances </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>a) Object of Veneration</h4>
<p>Some ÅrÄvakas say that it is illogical to worship the buddhas by making offerings to oneself. Our bodies are made of impure substances and our minds are filled with anger and attachment. If that were the case, it would also be illogical to make offerings to statues or paintings (as they do), since the artist has anger and attachment, and the paint too is made of impure elements. Nevertheless, it is stated in the sÅ«tras that merit is obtained by venerating them in the belief that they are buddhas. Meditating upon oneself as a buddha and making offerings therefore yields the merit of making offerings to the buddhas. This is stated in both the sÅ«tras and tantras. As <em>Maitreya's</em> <em>Lion's Roar</em> says:<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[50]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever wishes to worship the Buddha should worship oneself.<br/>
Whoever wishes to worship the relics of the Buddha should worship oneself. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tantra <em>Purifying Evil Destinies</em> states:<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[51]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, when you assume the being of Vajrasattva,<br/>
Whatever you eat or do<br/>
Is unstained by any fault,<br/>
What need is there to speak of having compassion? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this is likewise explained in detail other tantras, for the sake of brevity I will not elaborate further.</p>
<h4>b) Time</h4>
<p>Some assert that the time for offering to the buddhas is in the morning and that to offer in the evening is illogical. Yet when the deities gather on auspicious days, such as the eighth day of the lunar month, you [ÅrÄvakas] consider that a good time to make offerings. In the same way, since the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s gather at night, the evenings present an auspicious occasion. As the <em>Vajraá¸Äka</em> states:<a href="#fn:52" id="fnref:52" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[52]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The women of this land<br/>
Will grant siddhis to the practitioners.<br/>
Always active during the night,<br/>
Always gathering during the night.<br/>
Great celestial accomplishments,<br/>
So difficult to obtain, will be granted. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Secret Tantra of the Common Procedures</em> states:<a href="#fn:53" id="fnref:53" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[53]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the deities gather at sunset,<br/>
It is certainly a sacred occasion.<br/>
Thus it is virtuous to offer to them<br/>
And request their departure before sunrise. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The night is therefore said to be a sacred time when blessings are conferred.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding the downfalls of the ÅrÄvakas, there are those that consider matter as primary and those that consider perception as primary. Since the sole reference is the mind that thinks of morning and evening, polluted and unpolluted, killing and stealing and so forth, of the two, perception is clearly the more important. Thus there is no fault in eating in the evening if you are able to maintain the perception that it is morning, whereas there is a fault in eating in the morning if you maintain the perception that it is evening. If you maintain the perception that women are men, there is no fault in touching them, whereas there is a fault in touching men if you maintain the perception that they are women. Although you know that they are women, if you are able to fully control your perception, it is possible to avoid the corresponding downfalls. The <em>RatnakÅ«á¹­a</em> states:<a href="#fn:54" id="fnref:54" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[54]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bodhisattva Gaá¹apravara<a href="#fn:55" id="fnref:55" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[55]</a> using the door of Dharma in which the external element is one with the internal earth element,<a href="#fn:56" id="fnref:56" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[56]</a> took the hand of a women and sat upon a seat. In that moment, Änanda developed a lack of faith. Gaá¹apravara then displayed a miracle, which dispelled Änanda's misconceptions. Thus, there was no downfall in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, if you meditate on the garuá¸a, then even if you consume poison the toxins will not affect you. If you engage in rejuvenation practice (<em>rasÄyana</em>) without knowing how to practice it, it will prove fatal. Similarly, if you know how to meditate on the maá¹á¸ala of the tathÄgatas, consuming food will become a cause for buddhahood, while not knowing this will become a cause for rebirth in the lower realms. This was confirmed by the master Äryadeva, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By meditating on the garuá¸a,<br/>
You will be able to consume any poison. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even a small lump of iron<br/>
Will sink to the bottom of the sea.<br/>
However, if you mould it into a vessel,<br/>
It can become a ship that carries you to liberation. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>c) Substances</h4>
<h5>i. Refutation of Objections Regarding Foods and Drinks</h5>
<p>Some ÅrÄvakas maintain that the offerings to the Buddha should consist of such pure substances as the three whites and three sweets, while impure substances like meat and alcohol should not be offered. Substances like the three whites, three sweets and water are indeed virtuous and pure offerings for the Buddha. Offerings to the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s, however, require meat and alcohol, in order that the auspicious circumstances may be created for attracting the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s. You need water to attract swans, flowers to attract bees, and meat to attract flies. If you lack knowledge, substances such as mercury and calcareous sinter may harm you, but if you know how to use them, they can become substances of rejuvenation and cause your lifespan to rival that of the sun and moon. Similarly, if you do not know the nature of the five meats and five amá¹tas, they will become a cause for rebirth in the lower realms, but if you do know, they will become a cause for buddhahood. Using the three medicinal fruits<a href="#fn:57" id="fnref:57" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[57]</a> in rejuvenation practice cannot kill you, just as it cannot enable you to live as long as the sun and the moon. Substances such as the three sweets, when consumed, cannot lead to the hell realms, just as they cannot serve as causes for buddhahod. The master Ravigupta said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone is able to harm you,<br/>
He is also able to help you,<br/>
Like the sun which causes both drought and rain.<br/>
The moon does not have this capacity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, the five meats and five amá¹tas are easy to find and not unwholesome. They are blessed by the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s and said to be endowed with the three qualities.</p>
<h5>ii. Refutation of Objections Regarding Vessels and Decoration</h5>
<p>Some ÅrÄvakas state that it is best to use vessels made from oyster or conch shells and decorations using pearls and ivory. And for textiles, it is best to use silk. They ask if it is not inappropriate to use such extremely impure objects as skulls for vessels, human bone for decoration, and human hair for thread.</p>
<p>In response, I would ask whether human or animals are better.<a href="#fn:58" id="fnref:58" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[58]</a> If the response is that a human body is far better since it results from merit, whereas an animal body results from non-virtue and is therefore inferior, I would ask why hair and bones that are produced by merit are bad while bones produced by non-virtue are good. Put your mind at ease! Tantras such as the <em>Cakrasaá¹vara</em> state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If conch, oysters and pearls<br/>
Are the result of the causes,<a href="#fn:59" id="fnref:59" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[59]</a><br/>
Who would criticize the use of skulls<br/>
From the form of the dharmakÄya?<br/>
For heroes, wearing a skull garland<br/>

<p>Thus, my teacher, the great Vajradhara in person,<a href="#fn:61" id="fnref:61" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[61]</a> said, &quot;The view, meditation and conduct of the Secret Mantra are entirely established by logic based on facts.&quot; The extensive logical arguments and scriptural citations that establish the validity of the Secret Mantra vehicle can be found in such works as those by the noble teachers NÄgÄrjuna and Äryadeva, the master BuddhajÃ±ÄnapÄda's <em>Introduction to the Art of Self-Accomplishment</em>,<a href="#fn:62" id="fnref:62" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[62]</a> and the master ÅÄntaraká¹£ita's <em>Establishing Suchness</em>.<a href="#fn:63" id="fnref:63" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[63]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<li>The occasions</li>
<li>The deity yogas</li>
<li>The purposes</li>
<li>The objects of offering</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>1. Participants</h3>
<p>When both vÄ«ras and yoginÄ«s gather together that is called a âgaá¹acakra'. If only vÄ«ras gather, it is called a 'vÄ«ras' feast'; wheras if only yoginÄ«s gather, it is called called a 'yoginÄ«s' feast'.</p>
<h3>2. Occasions</h3>
<p>When performing an empowerment or a consecration, or a fire offering it is called a <em>caru banquet</em>.<a href="#fn:65" id="fnref:65" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[65]</a></p>
<h3>3. Deity Yogas</h3>
<p>If the gathering consists of varying practitioners of different deity yogas, such as Hevajra or the Cakrasaá¹vara, it is called a 'gathering of friends'.</p>
<h3>4. Purposes</h3>
<p>All the maá¹á¸ala deities adopt the dancing posture to invoke the compassion of the buddhas so that all the harm in the world may be pacified. When the combination of song and dance causes the wrathful kings to laugh and the dance of mind invokes the wisdom minds of the buddhas, pacifying beingsâ suffering, it is called 'the dance of the buddhas'.</p>
<h3>5. Objects of Offering</h3>
<p>The women who are supports for the worldly and the world-transcending á¸ÄkinÄ«s are marked by symbols such as a skull or an axe. The consort who is offered to the leader of the ritual should possess the proper characteristics. The women are to be offered within the maá¹á¸ala house. Gather the requisite number of virgins, corresponding to the number of deities in the maá¹á¸alaâwhether five, seven or thirty-sevenâin front of the curtains of the maá¹á¸ala house. Serve them food, drink and clothing. This is called 'the feast of maidensâ. </p>
<p>This concludes my explanation of the stages of the practice of the great and glorious Sakyapa, kings of dharma, based on the niruttarayoga tantras, the commentaries of the siddhas, and the pith instructions of the gurus.</p>
<p><em>The Vajradhara in human form,</em><br/>
<em>Who upholds the lineage of accomplished gurus,</em><br/>
<em>And resides at the seat of the Sakyas, extracted and taught this ritual</em><br/>
<em>In accord with the meaning of the stainless tantras.</em><a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[66]</a><br/>
<em>Since his perfect explanation was a little unclear to some,</em><br/>
<em>At the request of several supplicants,</em><br/>
<em>The one named Kunga,</em>
<em>Who revered the dust at his feet,</em><br/>
<em>Composed this clarification.</em> </p>
<p><em>Through this virtue,</em><br/>
<em>May all infinite beings, as vast as space,</em><br/>
<em>Swiftly perfect the accumulations of merit and wisdom</em><br/>
<em>And within this life reach the state of Vajradhara.</em> </p>
<p><em>Thus, at the request of supplicants, the glorious Sakya Paá¹á¸ita further clarified the teaching on the stages of practice of the gaá¹acakra according to the niruttarayoga tantras by the Dharma-King who is adorned by a crowning Victory Banner (Gyaltsen).</em><a href="#fn:67" id="fnref:67" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[67]</a></p>

<p>That is to say, the fellow practitioners prior to the performance of the gaá¹acakra ritual use a specific hand gesture. By correctly showing the hand gesture to the guard, the fellow practitioner will be allowed to enter. Those who are unable to show the hand gesture correctly will not be permitted to enter.
